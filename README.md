In this project, I focused on a very specific task: creating a recommendation system using the Transformer architecture, inspired by the "Attention is All You Need" paper [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762). While there are a variety of models tailored to solve different problems, the goal here was to demonstrate how Transformers, known for their ability to handle sequential data and capture long-range dependencies, can be applied effectively in the domain of **recommendation systems**. Using the MovieLens dataset, this project walks through the entire process—from data preprocessing and sequence generation to model training and evaluation—showcasing the power of Transformers in generating personalized movie recommendations. 

**Another main objective of this process was to explain every single step in the process to help people think of a Transformer as a 'black box,' emphasizing that there's no magic involved, and each step has its logical and mathematical explanation.**

By providing a clear, well-documented guide, I hope to help others understand and replicate this approach with confidence.
