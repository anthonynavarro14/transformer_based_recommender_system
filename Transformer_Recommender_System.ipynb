However, creating effective recommendation systems is challenging due to the complexity of predicting user behavior from vast amounts of sequential data. Traditional methods often struggle with this task. That's why I decided to implement a Transformer architecture, known for its ability to process sequential data with self-attention mechanisms that capture long-range dependencies and intricate patterns in user interactions.\n","\n","\n","For this project, I chose the `MovieLens` dataset because it is one of the most popular and accessible datasets for recommender systems, making it easy for anyone to replicate and build upon. Using user IDs and movie sequences, we'll build personalized movie recommendations. This project covers everything from data upload and preprocessing to sequence generation, building the `Transformer` model, and evaluating the results."],"metadata":{"id":"jYCyn3Lfjxnv"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Main Goal"],"metadata":{"id":"rDWmdWcmmq3H"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The main goal of this project is to help others understand Transformer architectures and their logic, making them easier to digest.
